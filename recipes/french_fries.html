    <h3>Ingredients -</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps -</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning
            brown.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl.
            Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
        <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time and place in hot oil to prevent them from
            clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes; drain on a paper
            towel-lined plate.</li>
    </ol>
